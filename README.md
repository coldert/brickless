Like Arkanoid but without the bricks.

This is a simple game where you should keep the ball bouncing while moving the paddle as little as possible.
A counter keeps counting up a temporary score, but when you move the paddle the counter is reset.
The temporary score is added to the main score each time the ball hits the paddle.
When the ball hits the paddle the speed is increased sligtly.

I did this to brush up on my javascript skills, so any critique, suggestions or tips are very welcome :)
